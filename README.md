IBPWebService
============

Overview
----------
IBPWebService is a RESTful web service that aims to integrate Breeding View application with the Breeding Management System (BMS). It provides services for saving the analysis result to the BMS's database. 

For API Documentation, run the IBPWebService and go to the following URL:
<pre>http:/localhost:18080/IBPWebService/rest/index</pre>

Checkout this project
-----------------------
The project is stored in the GIT repository hosted at github.com.  The URL for the repository is:

An anonymous account may be used to checkout the project.  

No username and password is required.  You can also browse the content of the repository using the same URL.  

Dependencies to other projects
-------------------------------

IBPWebService is dependent on Middleware and IBPCommons. See [IBPCommons][ibpcommons_git_link], [IBPMiddleware][ibpmiddleware_git_link] for build instructions on those modules.

To Build
----------
You need Maven to build the project.

Configuration files are found on [./pipeline/config][configuration_link] you can make the built-in configuration there as a template if you want to use a custom configuration for your build.

To build using a specific configuration, run the following:

	mvn clean package -DenvConfig=dev-config-dir -DskipTests  
 
where `dev-config-dir` is the configuration specific to your build.

The `package` option tells maven to create a packaged .war file you can drop in the IBPWorkflow installation tomcat web-apps directory 

`-DskipTests` is optional, if you want to run unit-tests see [To Run Tests](#to-run-tests) section.

To Run Tests
--------------
To run JUnit tests using the command line, issue the following commands in the IBPWebService directory:

1. To run all tests: <pre>mvn clean test</pre>
2. To run a specific test class: <pre>mvn clean test -Dtest=TestClassName</pre>
3. To run a specific test function: <pre>mvn clean test -Dtest=TestClassName#testFunctionName</pre>

You need to specify the IBDB database to connect to in the `IBPDatasource.properties` file. 

All JUnit test suites require the rice database, except for `GenotypicDataManager` that uses the groundnut crop in testing.

Similar to building `IBPWebService`, add the `-DenvConfig` parameter to use a specific configuration.

To run JUnit tests using Eclipse, right-click on the specific JUnit test suite in the `IBPWorkbench` project, select __Run As --> JUnit test__.
